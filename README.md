# Attenton, please!
this initial release is just a barebones system, as I just decided to implement the **Yarn Spinner** tools as the backbone for the story flow.
So I decided to stop working on the tutorial until I have a stable system again.

# Neo Story Toolkit

This is a framework to create your own story driven 3D game.

The goal of this project is to provide a "complete" game with all the components like
* a way for writers to evolve the story without having to write (much c#) code ;)
* an event system for the base logic
* a UI
* a movement system
* footstep sounds depending on the ground the player walks on
* a camera system
* a health system
* several scenes
* background music
* pickups
* obstacles
